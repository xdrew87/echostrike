# EchoStrike

**EchoStrike** is a powerful and visually appealing TCP/UDP pinger designed for Arch Linux. It allows users to:

- Input multiple IP addresses or hostnames.
- Choose between TCP and UDP protocols.
- Specify custom TCP ports or use predefined UDP ports (53, 80, 6672).
- Continuously monitor connectivity with real-time feedback.
- Log results with timestamps and latency information.

## Features
